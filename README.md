open this file to have like an indefinite screen that says u got hacked.. the only way to get rid of the screen is to open task manager and end procces or shutdown/restart your PC. 

Its pretty easy to use.. and its not harmful to your pc at all.. so if it gets in the way.. right click on the task bar and open task manager. then look for the running
application thats running the infinate window (i forget what its called i think its a windows script file i forget) right lick on the application and click end process

or just restary/shutdown your PC lol
